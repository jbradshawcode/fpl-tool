## Ideas for Features / Capabilities
- View xPoints via calculation on expected stats
    - If no expected_defcon, decide on some aggregation of total defensive contributions -> points that seems fair
    - Maybe use data to fit this trend... scale factor mapping defensive contributions to defcon points awarded
