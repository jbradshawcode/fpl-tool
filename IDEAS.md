# Ideas for Features / Capabilities

- Definitely need to aggregate stats before doing per 90 stats
    - Bad edge case - a player plays 90 mins in four games, then 1 min in the 5th
    - Results in huge xPoints, very disproportionate
- Write something that adjusts for non-pens
- Figure out avg numbers of DEFCON points for a single fpl point
    - use this to do xDEFCON
